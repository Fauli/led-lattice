# DIY LED Lattice Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the DIY LED Lattice Project!
This guide will walk you through creating a stunning LED lattice using WS2812 LEDs and wood.
This project is perfect for those who love DIY electronics and woodworking.
The finished product will be a beautiful LED lattice that you can use for decorative lighting in your home, office or parties.

## Materials List
- WS2812 LED Strips (Ones with ~10cm distance between the individual lights)
- Wooden planks (size depends on desired lattice size)
    - I got some from Jumbo that were 240x56x10mm
- Wooden backplate
    - I used a plywood plate that is white on one side, 1200x600x4mm
- Soldering iron and solder
- Wire (for connecting LED strips)
- Microcontroller 
    - In my case I'm using a BC-216 Artnet to SPI/DMX Pixel light controller
- Screws (for assembling the lattice)
    - For the frame: 3x12 screws
    - For the rest: 3x20 screws
- Acryl spray for coloring the frame (optional)

## Tools Required
- Saw (for cutting wood)
- Drill
- Wire cutters and strippers
- Computer with an Artnet souce
